📢📢 Exciting INTERNSAVY Internship Task 3 Completed: Customer Segmentation Analysis 🎯🎉



🔍 Exploring Customer Segmentation! 💼👤💼

Hello LinkedIn fam! 🌟 I'm thrilled to share with you the results of my internship tasks, where I completed the engaging Customer Segmentation Analysis. 📊💡



🎯 Task Objectives:

During my INTERNSAVY internship, I embarked on a journey of data exploration and analysis. Task 3 involved in-depth analysis of customer data obtained from a mall. I examined various customer attributes to understand their preferences and behaviors, laying the foundation for the subsequent Customer Segmentation Analysis in Task 3.



🎯 Task Highlights:

In Task, I focused on the following key aspects:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I ensured the data was in good shape by handling missing values and verifying data types.

Data Visualization: I employed powerful Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations, such as histograms, count plots, and box plots, to understand the distribution and relationships of different attributes.

Insights Extraction: By interpreting the visualizations, I gained valuable insights into customer demographics, gender representation, and the distribution of annual income.



💻 Technical Tools Used:

To accomplish these tasks, I utilized Python and various data science libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.



🎯 Task 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis:

Building on the insights from Task 3, I moved on to the exciting Task 3 - Customer Segmentation Analysis. Using machine learning techniques, I applied K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer segments based on their age, annual income, and spending score.



📊 Key Findings:

1️⃣ Histogram for Age: Understanding the age distribution of customers, providing valuable insights into their demographics.

2️⃣ Count of Customers by Gender: Exploring the gender distribution of customers to understand representation.

3️⃣ Distribution of Annual Income: Visualizing the density of annual income to gain insights into customers' financial backgrounds.

4️⃣ Box Plot for Spending Score across Gender: Comparing spending scores between male and female customers.

5️⃣ Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering: Identifying five distinct customer segments based on age, annual income, and spending score.



🌟 Conclusion:

I'm elated to have successfully completed the Customer Segmentation Analysis as part of my INTERNSAVY internship. This journey has reinforced my passion for data science and equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis and machine learning.

I'm excited about the possibilities that data science offers in shaping smarter business strategies and solving real-world challenges.
